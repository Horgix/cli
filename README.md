## How to build?

The project is using go, then you need a running go environment: [Official documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install)

Once that's done, all you have to do is to 'go get' the project, with the following command:

That's it, you've build the latest version of the Scalingo CLI (the binary will be present in `$GOPATH/bin/scalingo`)


## How to upgrade?

```
go get -u github.com/Scalingo/cli/scalingo
```

## Run behind a proxy
